before 1.0 any minor release may change interfaces.

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

First release. Experimental.

### Added
- Drop-in SM120 replacements for DeepInfer's SM100-only kernel libraries (`sm120/`): `flash_mla` (sparse MLA decode
  and prefill, fused norm/RoPE/cast), `deep_gemm` (FP8 block GEMM, MQA indexer logits, grouped/fused MoE), `deep_ep`
  (single-GPU buffers, Engram buffer), `deep_select` (top-k), all on b12x 1.5.1, Triton, or exact torch references.
- Runtime patches installed through `sitecustomize` (`sm120/sm120_patches.py`, `sm120_patches_engram.py`), documented
  in `patches/PATCHES.md`.
- CUDA-graph decode and MTP/DSpark speculative decoding on SM120.
- Engram on SM120 without RDMA: host-mmapped tables, gathered asynchronously under CUDA graphs.
- Multi-GPU expert parallelism for PCIe-only machines (DP attention + EP MoE over NCCL, DP proxy). Tested in emulation only.
- OpenAI-compatible server (`server/`) with streaming, cancellation, seeded sampling, logprobs and exact prefix caching
  (`prefix_cache/`).
- Optional weight-only FP8 lm_head for decode (`SM120_LMHEAD_IMPL=fp8`, off by default).
- Validation tooling: DeepSeek reference runner, checkpoint truncation (3-layer, YOCO, full-depth presets), per-layer
  and intra-layer comparison against the reference noise floor (`tools/`).
- Serving image (`docker/Dockerfile`), which pins DeepInfer `8b16149741a4935e1dec8cea27853f273b374c5b` and b12x 1.5.1 and
  applies the b12x tiny-decode SwiGLU clamp fix (flashinfer-ai/flashinfer#6866). There is also a dev image (`docker/Dockerfile.dev`).

### Known limitations
- Validated on one RTX 5090 with truncated checkpoints only. The full model has not been run (it needs multiple GPUs).
- Layer 0 deviates from the reference by more than the noise floor. This is a property of DeepInfer's `fused_transform` rounding.
- The default b12x MoE is not run-to-run deterministic.
